    "\n",
    "All data that is worked with in GeoPySpark is at some point stored within a `RDD`. Therefore, it is important to understand how GeoPySpark stores, represents, and uses these `RDD`s throughout the library.\n",
    "\n",
    "GeoPySpark does not work with PySpark `RDD`s, but rather, uses Python classes that are wrappers of classes in Scala that contain and work with a Scala `RDD`. These classes being `RasterLayer` and `TiledRasterLayer` which be discuessed in more detail later.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Are the Python Classes Refered to as Layers?\n",
    "\n",
    "You might be wondering why we refer to the Python classes which wrap the Scala classes that contain the `RDD` as a layer not an `RDD`. This is for two reasons: the first being that neither `RasterLayer` or `TiledRasterLayer` extend PySpark's `RDD` class; the other is that these classes contain more information than just the `RDD`. When we refer to a \"layer\", we mean both the `RDD` and its attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "All `RDD`s in GeoPySpark contain tuples, whose values will be referred to in this guide as `(K, V)`. `V` will always be a `Tile`, but `K` differs depending on both the wrapper class and the nature of the data itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "### RasterLayer\n",
    "\n",
    "`RasterLayer` is one of the two wrapper classes in GeoPySpark and deals with untiled data. What does it mean for data to be untiled? It means that each element within the layer has not been modified in such a way that would make it a part of a larger, overall layout. For example, a distributed collection of rasters of a contiguous area could be derived from GeoTiffs of different sizes. This, in turn, could mean that there’s a lack of uniformity when viewing the area as a whole. It is this, “raw” data that is stored within `RasterLayer`.\n",
    "\n",
    "It would help to have all of the data uniform when working with it, and that is what `RasterLayer` accomplishes. The point of this class is to format the data within the layer to a specified layout.\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned in the previous section, both wrapper classes hold data in tuples. With the `K` of each tuple being different between the two. In the case of `RasterLayer`, `K` is either `ProjectedExtent` or `TemporalProjectedExtent`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### TiledRasterLayer\n",
    "\n",
    "`TiledRasterLayer` is the second of the two wrapper classes in GeoPySpark and deals with tiled data. Which means the rasters inside of the layer have been fitted to a certain layout. The benefit of having data in this state is that now it will be easy to work with. It is with this class that the user will be able to perform map algebra, pyramid, and save the layer among other operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of `TiledRasterLayer`, `K` is either `SpatialKey` or `SpaceTimeKey`."
